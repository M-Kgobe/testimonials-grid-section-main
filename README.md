## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

*adding google fonts to HTML and CSS
*using box-shadow


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.name{
box-shadow: 2px 2px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
body{
    justify-content: center;  
    align-items: center;
    margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

1. I would like to focus more on aligning grids to a specific position on the wepage, I seem to  take longer to figure out that, perhaps even try out new grid displays.
2. Distinguish where to use a grid vs flexbox.
3. Making a background image in grid.
